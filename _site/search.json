      "author": [],
      "contents": "\r\nWe are a group of (early career) researchers working on pragmatics and discourse, broadly construed. Our aim is to bring together people working on such topics to discuss issues related to the practice of experimental research on human language use and communication.\r\nOur group is specifically focused on meta-theoretical issues related to how the practice of experimental pragmatic and discourse research is constrained by the different frameworks found in the field (i.e. Neo- and Post-Gricean pragmatics, discourse representation theories, information theory, etc.). We are also interested in concrete issues related to linking abstract theoretical constructs to empirical measures, and how that affects the design and setup of experiments. Our ultimate goals are:\r\nto critically assess the (in)compatibility of different conceptual frameworks available in the field from the perspective of applied empirical practice;\r\nto work with the community towards developing best practices for designing experimental tasks which are both ecologically valid and theoretically stringent but also fitting for the specific purposes of sub-communities working on pragmatic and discourse phenomena.\r\nIf you’re curious and would like to know more, join one of our upcoming meetings or drop us a line. We would love to hear from you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
