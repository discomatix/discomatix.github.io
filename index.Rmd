### Who?

We are a group of (early career) researchers working on **Disco**urse and prag**Mati**cs using e**X**perimental approaches. Our group is specifically focused on the interface between theoretical and empirical approaches.

### What? 

We bring together interested researchers in the fields of discourse and pragmatics to exchange ideas and experiences. Through these encounters, we aim to:

* critically assess the (in)compatibility of different theoretical frameworks in the field of discourse and pragmatics
* develop best practices for empirically testing theoretical predictions in ecologically valid and theoretically stringent tasks

Our first step is an on-line series, in which invited speakers discuss issues related to the above topics and researchers will have the opportunity to engage in discussion (see [Meetings](https://discomatix.github.io/meetings.html)).

### Why?

Empirical research in this field is difficult for two reasons: 

* first, there is a gap between theoretical constructs and testable predictions

* second, there is a tension between the contextual nature of discourse and pragmatics and experimental control
